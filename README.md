# e-plantShopping

This application is a Paradise Nursery shopping app, which shows some types of plants and a cart to buy them. Vite, React, and Redux are used to code the front-end and manage the state of the application. This project uses a template provided by IBM Developer Skills Network as a submission for the final project of the Developing Front-End Apps with React course.
